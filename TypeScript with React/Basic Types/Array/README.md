# TypeScript Arrays

This section is dedicated to understanding the `array` type in TypeScript and its usage in React development.

## Contents

- [Array Overview](README.md): An introduction to arrays in TypeScript and how they can be utilized in React.
- [Array Operations](ArrayOperations.tsx): Examples showcasing the use of arrays in TypeScript within the context of a React application.

## Array Overview

The TypeScript `array` type is used for declaring a collection of values. Arrays in TypeScript can be written in two different ways: using the type of the elements followed by `[]`, or using a generic array type. They are versatile and fundamental in handling lists of items in React applications.

## Key Points

- **Array Declaration**: Arrays can be declared either by using the type followed by `[]`, or using the generic `Array` type.
- **Typed Arrays**: Each element in a TypeScript array is of the same type, ensuring consistency and predictability in your data structures.
- **Common Operations**: TypeScript arrays support various operations like iteration, mapping, filtering, and reduction.

## Array Operations

This section covers various operations that can be performed with arrays in TypeScript, especially focusing on their application in React:

- **Manipulating Arrays**: Adding, removing, or modifying elements within an array.
- **Iterating over Arrays**: Using methods like `forEach`, `map`, and `filter`.
- **Complex Operations**: Techniques like sorting, reducing, and combining arrays.

Refer to the [ArrayOperations.tsx](ArrayOperations.tsx) file for practical examples and demonstrations of arrays in a React context.
