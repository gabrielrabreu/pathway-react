# TypeScript Booleans

This section is dedicated to understanding the `boolean` type in TypeScript and its usage in React development.

## Contents

- [Boolean Overview](README.md): An introduction to booleans in TypeScript and how they can be utilized in React.
- [Boolean Operations](BooleanOperations.tsx): Examples showcasing the use of booleans in TypeScript within the context of a React application.

## Boolean Overview

TypeScript `boolean` type is used to represent the truth values `true` and `false`, similar to booleans in JavaScript. They are fundamental for controlling program flow, making decisions, and handling user interactions in React applications.

## Boolean Operations

In this section, we explore various boolean operations in TypeScript, particularly focusing on their use in React:

- **Comparison Operators**: Compare values using operators like `===`, `!==`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=`.
- **Logical Operators**: Logical operations using `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), and `!` (NOT) to combine or invert boolean values.

Refer to the [BooleanOperations.tsx](BooleanOperations.tsx) file for practical examples and demonstrations of booleans in a React context.
