# TypeScript Void

This section is dedicated to understanding the `void` type in TypeScript and its usage in React development.

## Contents

- [Void Overview](README.md): An introduction to void in TypeScript and how they can be utilized in React.
- [Void Operations](VoidOperations.tsx): Examples showcasing the use of void in TypeScript within the context of a React application.

## Void Overview

TypeScript `void` type is used to signify the absence of a value or return type. It is commonly seen in function signatures where a function does not return a value. Understanding `void` is crucial for defining the behavior of functions in React, particularly event handlers and lifecycle methods.

## Key Points

- **Function Return Type**: In TypeScript, functions that do not return a value are annotated with `void`.
- **Event Handlers in React**: Many event handlers and lifecycle methods in React components use the `void` type, as they often do not need to return a value.
- **Best Practices**: Proper use of `void` can enhance code readability and intent, making it clear when a function is not meant to return anything.

## Void Operations

This section will cover:

- **Defining Void Functions**: How to declare functions with the `void` return type.
- **Using Void in React Components**: Practical uses of `void` in React, including event handlers and lifecycle methods.

Refer to the [VoidOperations.tsx](VoidOperations.tsx) file for practical examples and demonstrations of void in a React context.
