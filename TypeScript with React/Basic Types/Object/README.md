# TypeScript Object

This section is dedicated to understanding the `object` type in TypeScript and its usage in React development.

## Contents

- [Object Overview](README.md): An introduction to object in TypeScript and how they can be utilized in React.
- [Object Operations](ObjectOperations.tsx): Examples showcasing the use of object in TypeScript within the context of a React application.

## Object Overview

TypeScript `object` type is used to represent non-primitive types. Unlike primitive types (like `string`, `number`, `boolean`), the `object` type refers to instances of classes, arrays, or more complex data structures.

## Key Points

- **Non-Primitive Type**: The `object` type includes anything that isn't a primitive (not `number`, `string`, `boolean`, `symbol`, `null`, or `undefined`).
- **Object Type Declaration**: Demonstrating how to declare and use object types, including both object literals and instances of classes.
- **TypeScript's Type Checking for Objects**: Utilizing TypeScript's capabilities to ensure proper structure and type integrity for objects.

## Object Operations

This section covers:

- **Defining Object Types**: Techniques for declaring object types, including interfaces and type aliases.
- **Manipulating Objects**: How to work with objects, including accessing and modifying properties, and understanding immutability.
- **Using Objects in React Components**: Best practices for utilizing objects as state, props, or context in React components.

Refer to the [ObjectOperations.tsx](ObjectOperations.tsx) file for practical examples and demonstrations of objects in a React context.
