# TypeScript Basic Types in React

Welcome to the TypeScript Basic Types section of the PATHWAY-REACT repository. In this part of the repository, we explore the fundamental types in TypeScript and their practical applications in React development. Each type has its own dedicated folder containing a detailed `README.md` and example usage in a React context.

## Types Overview

Below is an overview of each basic type in TypeScript, with links to their respective folders containing more detailed information and examples:

### 1. [Boolean](Boolean/README.md)
Booleans are the simplest data type in TypeScript, representing true/false values.

### 2. [Number](Number/README.md)
TypeScript, like JavaScript, does not differentiate between integer and floating-point numbers.

### 3. [String](String/README.md)
Strings represent textual data and can be written using both single quotes (`'`) and double quotes (`"`).

### 4. [Array](Array/README.md)
Arrays can be written in one of two ways: using square brackets or using the generic `Array` type.

### 5. [Tuple](Tuple/README.md)
Tuples allow you to express an array with a fixed number of elements whose types are known.

### 6. [Enum](Enum/README.md)
Enums are a feature added to TypeScript to make working with sets of related constants easier.

### 7. [Any](Any/README.md)
The `any` type is used to bypass type checking, allowing for any type of value.

### 8. [Void](Void/README.md)
Commonly used as the return type of functions that do not return a value.

### 9. [Null and Undefined](Null%20and%20Undefined/README.md)
Both have their own types in TypeScript, named `null` and `undefined`.

### 10. [Never](Never/README.md)
The `never` type represents types of values that never occur.

### 11. [Object](Object/README.md)
Represents non-primitive types in TypeScript, anything that is not a number, string, boolean, etc.
