# TypeScript Null and Undefined Types

This section is dedicated to understanding the `null` and `undefined` type in TypeScript and its usage in React development.

## Contents

- [Null and Undefined Overview](README.md): An introduction to the `null` and `undefined` types in TypeScript, and how they are used in the context of React.
- [Null and Undefined Operations](NullAndUndefinedOperations.tsx): Examples that demonstrate handling `null` and `undefined` values in TypeScript within a React application.

## Null and Undefined Overview

In TypeScript, `null` and `undefined` have their own types named `null` and `undefined`, respectively. While they often serve similar purposes in representing the absence of a value, there are subtle differences in how they are used and interpreted in TypeScript.

## Key Points

- **Null**: Typically used to represent an intentional absence of an object value.
- **Undefined**: Commonly used to indicate that a variable has not been assigned a value.
- **TypeScript's Strict Null Checking**: With strict null checking enabled, variables explicitly declared as either `null` or `undefined` cannot be assigned values of the other type.

## Null and Undefined Operations

This section will cover:

- **Handling Null and Undefined**: Strategies for dealing with `null` and `undefined` in TypeScript, including null checks and optional chaining.
- **Usage in React Components**: How to handle `null` and `undefined` in props, state, and event handling in React.
- **Best Practices**: Understanding when to use `null` and `undefined` for better code clarity and reliability.

Refer to the [NullAndUndefinedOperations.tsx](NullAndUndefinedOperations.tsx) file for practical examples and demonstrations of null and undefined in a React context.
