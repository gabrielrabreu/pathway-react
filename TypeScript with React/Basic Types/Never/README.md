# TypeScript Never

In this section, we delve into the `never` type in TypeScript and its implications in React development.

## Contents

- [Never Overview](README.md): An introduction to never in TypeScript and how they can be utilized in React.
- [Never Operations](NeverOperations.tsx): Examples showcasing the use of never in TypeScript within the context of a React application.

## Never Overview

TypeScript `never` type is used to represent values that never occur. This type is used in situations where a value is not expected to exist or a function is not expected to return successfully. It's a powerful concept for ensuring code correctness and handling edge cases.

## Key Points

- **Function Return Type**: The `never` type is often used for functions that do not return a value, not because they return `void`, but because they always throw an error or never finish running.
- **Exhaustiveness Checking**: The `never` type is useful for exhaustiveness checks in switch statements or conditional types, where every possible case should be covered.
- **Type Guarding**: It can be used in scenarios where type narrowing leads to a state which shouldn't exist, ensuring type safety.

## Never Operations

This section will cover:

- **Defining Never Functions**: How to declare functions with a `never` return type, typically for functions that throw errors.
- **Exhaustiveness Checks**: Using the `never` type in exhaustive conditionals, ensuring that all possible cases in a union type are handled.
- **Type Guarding with Never**: Examples of leveraging `never` for type guarding in React components.

Refer to the [NeverOperations.tsx](NeverOperations.tsx) file for practical examples and demonstrations of never in a React context.
