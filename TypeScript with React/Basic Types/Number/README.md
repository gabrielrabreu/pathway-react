# TypeScript Numbers

This section is dedicated to understanding the `number` type in TypeScript and its usage in React development.

## Contents

- [Number Overview](README.md): An introduction to numbers in TypeScript and how they can be utilized in React.
- [Number Operations](NumberOperations.tsx): Examples showcasing the use of numbers in TypeScript within the context of a React application.

## Number Overview

TypeScript `number` type is used to represent both integers and floating-point numbers. Unlike some languages, TypeScript does not differentiate between different types of numeric values - all are treated as floating-point values. This mirrors JavaScript's approach to numbers but with the added type safety that TypeScript provides.

## Number Operations

In this section, we will look at basic arithmetic operations that can be performed with numbers in TypeScript, particularly focusing on their use in React:

- **Basic Arithmetic**: Operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Usage in React**: How to handle state and props in React components using numeric values.

Refer to the [NumberOperations.tsx](NumberOperations.tsx) file for practical examples and demonstrations of numbers in a React context.
