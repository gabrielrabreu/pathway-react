# State and Lifecycle in React with TypeScript

This section explores managing state and understanding the lifecycle of React components. We'll look at how these concepts apply to both functional and class components, with a focus on TypeScript integration.

## Managing State in Functional Components

### `useState` Hook

`useState` is a Hook that lets you add React state to functional components. In classes, the state is always an object, but with `useState` in functional components, the state can be any type. TypeScript can be used to define the type of this state, enhancing code reliability and readability.

See [Use State](UseStateExample.tsx) for a basic counter component demonstrates how to use `useState` to manage a numeric state.

### `useEffect` Hook

`useEffect` is a Hook that manages side-effects in functional components. It serves the same purpose as `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` in React classes, but unified into a single API. TypeScript aids in defining the types for any external values or functions used within the effect.

See [Use Effect](UseEffectExample.tsx) for an example showing a timer that counts up every second, illustrating the use of `useEffect` for handling side effects like intervals.

## Lifecycle Methods in Class Components

Lifecycle methods in class components are crucial for managing side effects, data fetching, subscriptions, and manually triggering updates. TypeScript enhances these methods by providing type safety for props and state, ensuring that the component behaves as expected.

See [Lifecycle](LifecycleExample.tsx) for component that logs messages to the console at different lifecycle stages, demonstrating `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`.
