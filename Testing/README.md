# Testing in React with Jest and Cypress

Welcome to the "Testing" section of this repository. This section covers testing your React applications using two popular testing frameworks: Jest and Cypress.

## Overview

Testing is a crucial part of ensuring the reliability and functionality of your React applications. This section provides an introduction to two types of tests:

- **Unit Tests with Jest:** Jest is a popular JavaScript testing framework that is often used for writing unit tests. It allows you to test individual components, functions, and modules in isolation.

- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests with Cypress:** Cypress is a powerful end-to-end testing framework specifically designed for testing web applications. It enables you to simulate real user interactions and test your application as a whole.

## Getting Started

To get started with testing in your React application, you can explore the following guides:

- [Jest Testing Guide](Jest/README.md): Learn how to write unit tests for your React components, functions, and modules using Jest. Jest provides a robust set of tools for testing, including mocking, assertions, and test runners.

- [Cypress Testing Guide](Cypress/README.md): Dive into end-to-end testing using Cypress. Cypress allows you to write E2E tests that simulate user interactions and validate your application's behavior.
