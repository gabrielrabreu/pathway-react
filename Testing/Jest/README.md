# Testing with Jest

Welcome to the "Testing with Jest" section of this repository. In this section, you will learn how to use Jest, a popular JavaScript testing framework, for writing and running tests. Jest simplifies the testing process and helps ensure the correctness of your code.

## Writing Tests

Writing tests is an essential part of software development. Jest provides a powerful and easy-to-use framework for creating unit tests, integration tests, and more. You can write tests for your React components, utility functions, and other parts of your application.

## Example Test

See [UnitTestExample.tsx](UnitTestExample.tsx) for an example of a Jest unit test.

## Code Coverage

Test coverage is an important metric to track how much of your codebase is covered by tests. Jest provides built-in support for generating code coverage reports, allowing you to identify areas of your code that need more testing.

## Mocking

Jest also provides tools for mocking dependencies and simulating various scenarios in your tests. You can create mock functions, objects, and modules to isolate the code you want to test and control its behavior.
