# Cypress Testing

Welcome to the Cypress Testing section of this repository. This section provides examples and guidance on how to perform different types of tests using Cypress, a powerful end-to-end testing framework.

## Cypress Installation

Before running Cypress tests, make sure to install Cypress as a dev dependency in your project:

[Install Cypress via npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cypress)

## Test Types

### End-to-End (E2E) Tests

End-to-End (E2E) tests simulate real user interactions with your application and are used to verify its functionality across different components and pages.

### Component Tests

Component tests focus on testing individual components in isolation. These tests help ensure that each component behaves correctly and maintains its functionality when changes are made.

## Example Tests

### Example E2E Test

See [E2ETestExample.tsx](E2ETestExample.tsx) for an example of an E2E test using Cypress. This test navigates to a website, interacts with elements, and makes assertions.

### Example Component Test

See [ComponentTestExample.tsx](ComponentTestExample.tsx) for an example of a component test using Cypress. This test focuses on testing individual components in isolation.
