# Basic Routing in React with TypeScript

This section covers the basics of routing in React applications using TypeScript. We'll explore how to set up routing, create routes, and navigate between them.

## Installation

To get started with routing in React, you need to install a routing library. We recommend using [react-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom). You can install it from npm: [react-router-dom npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom).

## Creating Routes

With `react-router-dom` installed, you can start defining routes in your application. Routes determine what component is rendered based on the URL. Here's an example of how to create a basic route:

See [BasicRoute.tsx](BasicRoute.tsx) for an example of a basic route.

In this example, we've created two routes, one for the Home page and another for the About page. You can create your components and define routes accordingly.

## Navigating Between Routes

Navigating between routes is as simple as using the `Link` component provided by `react-router-dom`. You can create links that take users to specific routes in your application.
