# Route Parameters in React with TypeScript

This section covers the concept of using route parameters in a React application with TypeScript and `react-router-dom`. Route parameters allow you to capture dynamic values from the URL and use them in your components.

## Defining Route Parameters

To define route parameters, you can use the `Route` component from `react-router-dom`. Here's an example of how to define route parameters:

See [DefiningRouteParameters.tsx](DefiningRouteParameters.tsx) for an example of defining route parameters.

In this example, we define a route parameter `:id` to capture a dynamic value from the URL.

## Accessing Route Parameters

Once you've defined route parameters, you can access them in your component using the `useParams` hook from `react-router-dom`. Here's how you can use it:

See [AccessingRouteParameters.tsx](AccessingRouteParameters.tsx) for an example of accessing route parameters.

In this example, we use the `useParams` hook to access the `:id` route parameter and display it in the component.
