# Nested Routes in React with TypeScript

This section covers the concept of nested routes in React applications using TypeScript. Nested routes allow you to create complex page structures with multiple levels of routing and content rendering. We'll explore how to set up and use nested routes in a React application with TypeScript.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into nested routes, make sure you have a basic understanding of React, TypeScript, and how to set up routing in a React application. If you are new to these topics, consider going through the relevant sections in this repository.

## Setting Up Nested Routes

To create nested routes, you'll typically follow these steps:

1. **Set up the Parent Route**: Define a parent route that will serve as the container for the nested routes. This parent route will render its content and act as a layout for the nested pages.

2. **Configure Child Routes**: Within the parent route, configure child routes using a routing library like React Router. Child routes represent specific pages or sections within the parent route.

3. **Render Child Routes**: In the parent component, include a section or component that will render the child routes. This is usually where the nested content will be displayed.

4. **Navigate to Nested Routes**: Implement navigation links or components that allow users to navigate to the nested routes. These links should point to the child routes you've configured.

## Example

To create nested routes, you need to define a nested route configuration within a parent route component. Here's an example:

See [NestedRoutes.tsx](NestedRoutes.tsx) for an example of defining nested routes.

In this example, we have a parent route for a dashboard and two nested routes for the dashboard's home and settings sections. Nested routes allow you to render components specific to each section.
