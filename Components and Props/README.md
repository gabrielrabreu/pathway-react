# Components and Props in React

This section focuses on understanding the two primary ways to create components in React: functional and class components. 

## Introduction to Components and Props

Components are the building blocks of any React application, and props (short for properties) are a way to pass data from parent to child components. In this section, we explore how these concepts are implemented in React.

## Functional Components vs. Class Components

### Functional Components

A functional component is a JavaScript function that returns a React element. With the introduction of Hooks in React 16.8, functional components can also manage state and other React features.

See [Functional Component](FunctionalComponentExample.tsx) for an example.

In this example, FunctionalComponent is a functional component that accepts props and uses the useState hook to manage a counter.

### Class Components

A class component is a JavaScript class that extends React.Component and has a render() method that returns a React element. Class components can have state and lifecycle methods.

See [Class Component](ClassComponentExample.tsx) for an example

In this example, ClassComponent is a class component that also has a counter, but the logic to manage the state is slightly different compared to the functional component.

### Comparision

While functional components use hooks (like useState) for managing states and effects, class components use this.state and this.setState for state management and lifecycle methods like componentDidMount to handle effects.

Functional components tend to be more concise and are the recommended approach for components in modern React, especially with the introduction of hooks that offer a more straightforward way to use React features like state, context, and others.
