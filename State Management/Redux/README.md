# Redux with TypeScript

Welcome to the "Redux with TypeScript" section of this repository. This section provides a basic example of using Redux for state management in a React application with TypeScript.

## Example Files

To see a basic implementation of Redux with TypeScript, you can check the following files:

- [CounterComponent.tsx](CounterComponent.tsx): This is a React component that displays a counter and allows you to increment and decrement its value. It uses Redux for state management.
- [redux/counterSlice.ts](redux/counterSlice.ts): This file defines a Redux slice that contains the state and reducers for the counter.

These examples demonstrate how to set up Redux in a TypeScript-based React application and use it for basic state management.
