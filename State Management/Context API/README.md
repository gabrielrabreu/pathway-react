- [Type-Safe Context](#type-safe-context): Discover how to make use of TypeScript to ensure type safety when working with context.

## Context Basics

The Context API in React allows you to share data between components without the need for prop drilling. In this section, you'll find guides and examples demonstrating how to create and use context in your React applications.

For practical examples and demonstrations, refer to the [ContextExamples.tsx](ContextExamples.tsx) file in this section.

## Type-Safe Context

One of the advantages of using TypeScript with the Context API is the ability to enforce type safety when working with context values. Learn how to leverage TypeScript to ensure that your context values are properly typed.

For type-safe context examples, refer to the [TypeSafeContext.tsx](TypeSafeContext.tsx) file in this section.
