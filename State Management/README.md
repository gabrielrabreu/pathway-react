# State Management in React with TypeScript

Welcome to the "State Management" section of this repository. This section is dedicated to helping you understand and implement effective state management solutions in React applications using TypeScript. We'll explore two essential approaches: the Context API and Redux with TypeScript.

## Contents

Explore the following topics to master state management in React with TypeScript:

- [Context API](Context%20API/README.md): Learn how to use the Context API to manage state in your React components, with strong TypeScript typing for context values.
- [Redux](Redux/README.md): Dive into Redux, a powerful state management library, and discover how to leverage TypeScript for robust and type-safe Redux applications.

## Context API

The Context API is a built-in feature in React that allows you to share data between components without having to pass props manually at every level. In this section, you'll find guides, examples, and best practices for using the Context API effectively with TypeScript.

## Redux with TypeScript

Redux is a popular state management library for React applications, and TypeScript enhances its capabilities by providing type safety and improved developer experience. Explore how to set up and use Redux with TypeScript in your projects.
